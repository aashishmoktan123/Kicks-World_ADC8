The Single Responsibility Principle is closely related to the concepts of coupling and cohesion.  Coupling refers to how inextricably linked different aspects of an application are, while cohesion refers to how closely related the contents of a particular class or package may be.  All of the contents of a single class are tightly coupled together, since the class itself is a single unit that must either be entirely used or not at all (discounting static methods and data for the moment).  When other classes make use of a particular class, and that class changes, the depending classes must be tested to ensure they continue to function correctly with the new behavior of the class.
